## [Top-n Music Genre Neural Network](<https://github.com/beatsageo/Top_n>) - Senior Capstone

I managed the training data for the project, ultimately collecting 122,487 audio clips totalling to around 369.8 GB, running audio pre-processing over the dataset, and more generally managing the data involved, while also making creating visualizations of the data for reports, and playing a major role in group organization and planning.
